"""
Async Python client for the BLUETTI cloud API.

Extracted from
https://github.com/bluetti-official/bluetti-home-assistant's
custom_components/bluetti/api/, the same way
https://github.com/pyenphase/pyenphase backs the enphase_envoy Home Assistant
integration. Fully async, including the websocket push-update transport
(`aiohttp`'s native websocket client, no dedicated threads). Wiring
bluetti-home-assistant to depend on this package is a separate follow-up.
